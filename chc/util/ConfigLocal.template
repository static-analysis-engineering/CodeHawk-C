"""Personalized settings that modify and/or complement Config.py.

To use this file to configure the analysis, change its name to ConfigLocal.py and
make sure that it is in the same directory as Config.py

The config object passed to getLocals is the universal Config, you can update
any of that config's variables here if you want to use a value other than the default.
